**Project: Etch-a-Sketch**

*Simple implementation of Etch-a-sketch game from The Odin Project curriculum.*

LIVE VERSION: https://antoniosimonetti.github.io/etchAsketchTOP/  - Not suitable for mobile at the moment.

This is my second HTML/CSS/JS project.

**GAME IDEA**

The idea was to use a gameboy color screen as an empty canvas. The buttons were used for:

- Color Selection
- Erasor
- Reset
- Rainbow Mode
- Audio play / pause
- github redirection
- Size for the canvas 

I made some poor decision by design. This will be useful in the future before building new things. 

*-CSS-*

First time I used grid. The panel was generated using it.
Looking foreward to use more grid in the future, seems a very powerful tool to use in combination with flexbox.

*-JS-*

I learned how to toggle boolean values stored into variables.
I learned how to prevent event happening on some elements using the tagName.

**Improvements for the future:**

I should really start use a different approach before start building to prevent stupid mistake in the development, expecially with CSS.
In addition to that, I have to start to build for mobile too, I feel that it's better to start as soon as possible.

**Good things to look at:**

My JS it's little bit less messy, still a long road to go. My understanding of git are improved.
